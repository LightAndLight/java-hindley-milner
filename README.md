Implementation of Hindley-Milner type inference in Java

## ...Why?

I needed to test myself. Java/C#-esque "Object Oriented Programming" is just not practical for
modern day software development.

This paradigm and the languages that support it does not let us model problem domains both accurately and modularly. In the
Object Oriented style, and especially in modern Object Oriented languages, these facets are at the opposite ends of a scale.
You can have lots of one at the expense of the other.

We have tools and paradigms that, in a majority of cases, completely destroy this scale. Accuracy and modularity, with no compromises. It seems that for some reason many people believe we can do no better than the modern Object Oriented style.

I might do a write-up of of my thoughts on this. If your interested then stay tuned, or [spam my email](https://github.com/LightAndLight) or something.
